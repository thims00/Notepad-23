- File location/directory checking and error handling. "userData" and the respective directory structure will need to be initiated and verified.
- Add user modifiable settings for storage of data structure
	- What about a .gitignore?
- Statusbar: 
	- List the path of selection "Category / Specific file"

- Make the file list sorted alphanumerically

- Begin incorporating keyboard shortcuts for save, undo/redo, etc.
- Fix up the _event_handle() function. The naming convention and general order of self.pasvData in EditableListbox() is very fragile and prone to error.
- Do file validation so files can't be created in parent category folder.
