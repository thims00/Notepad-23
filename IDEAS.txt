Keybindings:
- Vim style keybindings for navigation
	- With modifiers for word, sentence skipping.
		- This should be fairly complete as to allow full navigation by nothing more than keyboard shortcuts. dwm style.
- Shortcuts to allow for quickly and easily jumping through the category files and quite possibly the categories.
	EG.
	- Cycle through categories previous|next
	- Jump around category files, Cntl-3 opens the 3rd file, etc.

	- Ctrl-c for exit?
	- Make some of the questionable shortcuts controllable in settings

TextGrid Structure Insertion:
	- Create a format that allows you to list data in a manner, click gridify, and the data
	is formatted into a character table for clean, tidy display. 
		- EG. -23,Some Data,category,id
		      -29,other data,yrogetac,id
		      -35,more data yet, bored, id

		(Hilight the data, edit|insert, and "columnize". The data is then structured 
		into character based, excel like table, in place.)
